## Smart Irrigation System with Distributed Hygrometers
Progetto IoT UNIMORE

This project was developed as part of a university exam and is an IoT-based smart irrigation system designed to optimize water usage for garden maintenance. It utilizes a network of hygrometers (soil moisture sensors) distributed across different areas. These sensors collect real-time soil moisture data and send it to a central system. The data is then used to control smart irrigation devices installed in customers' gardens.

The smart irrigation system automatically determines whether to water the garden, ensuring efficient water management by activating irrigation only when necessary based on the real-time moisture levels of the soil.
